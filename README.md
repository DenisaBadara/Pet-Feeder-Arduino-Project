# Pet-Feeder-Arduino-Project
This project describes an automatic pet feeder designed to dispense food at regular, controlled intervals using an Arduino microcontroller, a servo motor, a Real-Time Clock (RTC) module, an LCD screen, and three buttons. The system allows users to set feeding intervals and portion sizes, ensuring that pets receive their meals at scheduled times or manually, with a different button for each functionality.

This automatic pet feeder features:

    Interval and Portion Setting: Users can manually set feeding intervals and portion sizes using buttons. The LCD screen displays these settings.
    Automatic Dispensing: The servo motor dispenses food at scheduled times with precision, controlled by the RTC module.
    Manual Feeding: Users can activate feeding manually with a button, regardless of the schedule.
    Real-Time Display: The LCD shows the current interval and portion settings, updating in real-time.
    Real-Time Clock: The RTC module ensures accurate timing for scheduled feedings.
